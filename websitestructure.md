Tone & Design Guidelines
	•	Clarity First: Use plain language. Avoid overly technical jargon. Focus on real-world benefits (e.g., “Close more deals,” “Reach broader audiences,” “Save time”).
	•	Friendly & Professional: Because your main users are in sales and marketing, keep the tone confident but approachable.
	•	Visuals: Show actual avatars or a glimpse of the generation process. People are naturally curious about AI, so leverage visuals to communicate the realism.
	•	Easy Onboarding: Emphasize how simple it is to start. Minimize friction by placing a “Start Free Trial” button prominently and repeatedly.

This layout ensures that every critical page is either in the top navigation or easily accessible in the footer, covering all standard SaaS website needs—marketing, education, legal, and support—while making it straightforward for visitors to sign up or log in.
